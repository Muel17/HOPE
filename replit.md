# Portfolio Website - Replit.md

## Overview

This repository contains a dynamic and responsive portfolio website featuring advanced 3D effects, parallax animations, and interactive elements. The project is designed to showcase personal skills, projects, and certifications through an engaging visual experience with smooth animations and modern web technologies.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations and 3D transforms
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- **3D Effects**: CSS 3D transforms and custom parallax effects
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management

### Component Structure
- Modular design with separate files for each section
- Reusable components for cards, navigation, and interactive elements
- Separation of concerns between structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript)

## Key Components

### 1. Navigation System
- **Purpose**: Provides smooth navigation between portfolio sections
- **Implementation**: Fixed navigation bar with smooth scroll functionality
- **Features**: Responsive hamburger menu for mobile devices

### 2. 3D Parallax Homepage
- **Purpose**: Creates an immersive first impression with depth and movement
- **Implementation**: CSS 3D transforms with scroll-based animations
- **Elements**: Background layers moving at different speeds to create depth

### 3. Interactive Cursor
- **Purpose**: Enhances user engagement with custom visual feedback
- **Implementation**: JavaScript-based cursor tracking with CSS animations
- **Features**: Dynamic cursor that responds to hover states and interactions

### 4. 3D Character Integration
- **Purpose**: Provides personality and interactive dialogue with visitors
- **Implementation**: Animated 3D character with predefined dialogue responses
- **Features**: Context-aware responses and smooth animation transitions

### 5. Content Cards System
- **Purpose**: Displays skills, projects, and certifications in an organized manner
- **Implementation**: CSS Grid layout with hover effects and modal overlays
- **Features**: Expandable cards with detailed information and imagery

## Data Flow

### User Interaction Flow
1. **Initial Load**: Homepage with 3D parallax effect captures attention
2. **Navigation**: Smooth scroll transitions between sections
3. **Content Exploration**: Interactive cards reveal detailed information
4. **Character Interaction**: 3D character provides engaging dialogue
5. **Contact**: Easy access to contact information through footer

### Animation Lifecycle
1. **Page Load**: Sequential animation of elements for smooth introduction
2. **Scroll Events**: Parallax effects triggered by scroll position
3. **Hover States**: Interactive feedback on buttons and cards
4. **Character Animation**: Idle animations with interaction responses

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Libraries
- **Animation Libraries**: Potential integration with libraries like GSAP for complex animations
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js for advanced 3D character animations (if required)
- **Icon Libraries**: Font Awesome or similar for consistent iconography
- **Font Libraries**: Google Fonts for typography enhancement

### Browser APIs
- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-triggered animations
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: For smooth animation performance
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For dynamic theming and color management

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **Platform**: Suitable for static hosting platforms (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- **Build Process**: Minification of CSS and JavaScript for production
- **Asset Optimization**: Image compression and lazy loading for performance

### Performance Considerations
- **Code Splitting**: Separate files for different functionalities
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interactions and responsive design

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
